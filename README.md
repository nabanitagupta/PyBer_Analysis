# PyBer_Analysis
1.	Write a summary for the data in the summary DataFrame.
A summary DataFrame was built by merging the 2 DataFrames provided with ride sharing and city data. As can be expected, the Urban cities have highest number of rides i.e. 1625 compared to few 125 rides in the rural cities. Similar trends can be observed in the number of drivers as 2405 compared to 78 in urban and rural cities respectively. Average fares both per ride and per driver are highest in rural cities and go lower as we move through the suburban cities and urban cities. 

2.	Write a summary in on what the multiple line graph tells about the fares for each city type over time


A line plot has been made to capture any trends in fares for different cities for the first 4 months in 2019. Fares are summed up for each 7 days. The figure is saved in figure 8 in the analysis folder. It can be observed that the fares do not change much over the 4 months except for few peaks and troughs here and there. However, this plot needs to be observed along with the summary data. As this plot indicates the fares are highest in Urban cities and lowest in rural cities. This is not a true picture instead this is a result of fewer number of rides in rural cities compared to urban cities. The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver indicates that rides are much more expensive in the rural cities compared to urban cities.
